Hello! **EthicalHackers.club** is a personal blog/site of **Ameer Pornillos**, a cyber security enthusiast from Philippines. This site would be his journal about his journey in the world of ethical hacking, penetration testing, digital forensics and anything related to cyber security.

## Ethical Hackers Club

### Backstory:
This site started way back 2016 when he was studying and researching on ethical hacking / penetration testing in preparation for his OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional) certification (by the way here is his [OSCP review](https://ethicalhackers.club/oscp-penetration-testing-kali-linux-experience-review/) for the course). Also way back then, cyber security is not that trending in PH (Philippines), and even HR people in PH are not familiar with the course/certification (at least by author's view and experience during that time). Likewise he aimed to share write-ups and walkthroughs in solving VulnHub machines. Hence, the site was born.

He also used the name **Ethical Hackers Club** as a team name during the time he started actively playing and joining [CTFs](https://ctftime.org/team/32092) (Capture the Flag) security competitions.

### Present:
At present, the author works as an offensive security engineer / penetration tester for a Fortune 500 company and holds various certifications in security industry such as [OSCE](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/c005e433-d716-44a2-a157-8e1a522d657c), [OSWE](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/9495f7da-cf4a-49b4-bcc2-62d29c3c7588), [OSCP](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/b25903e3-221d-4f55-886c-70eaac04b7e9) and [GXPN](https://www.giac.org/certified-professional/Ameer-Pornillos/214237). He is also a member of [hackstreetboys](https://ctftime.org/team/43377), a CTF team from the Philippines. Way back 2021, the team did managed to grab the 3rd place in [DEFCON 29: Red Team Village CTF](https://youtu.be/EpeO_wJ0JCI?feature=shared&t=9220) where various cybersecurity challenges related to red teaming need to be solved.

In this site, he will be publishing his journey, adventures and things he learned/learning related to ethical hacking, forensics and any topics around cyber security. All the information in here is for educational purposes only. Note that Ethical Hackers Club content/s are based on the authorâ€™s learning and experience.
